                                <p className="text-white mb-4">
                                    The key pair generation process typically involves the following steps:
                                </p>
                                <ul className="list-unstyled text-white mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        Generate a large random number. This number will serve as the private key.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Derive the public key from the private key using a mathematical function.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p className="text-white mb-4">
                                    Key pair generation provides several benefits, including:
                                </p>
                                <ul className="list-unstyled text-white mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        Enhanced security: Since the private key is kept secret, it is much more difficult for an attacker to gain access to sensitive information.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Simplified key management: Instead of managing multiple keys for different users or applications, you only need to manage a single key pair.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Improved scalability: Key pair generation can be easily integrated into existing systems and can be used to secure a large number of users or devices.
                                    </li>

                                </h2>
                                <p className="text-white mb-4">
                                    In cybersecurity, key-pair generation is the process of creating a public and private key pair that is used for encryption and decryption of sensitive data.
                                </p>

                                <h2 className="text-green mb-4">What is the purpose of key-pair generation?</h2>
                                <p className="text-white mb-4">
                                    The purpose of key-pair generation is to create a secure and reliable method for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted.

                                <h2 className="text-green mb-4">What is the difference between a public and private key?</h2>
                                <p className="text-white mb-4">
                                    A public key is intended to be shared and used for encryption, while the private key must be kept secret and is used for decryption. A message encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.
